Solaris is GPM Holding’s solar panel manufacturing platform. The facility is designed to assemble photovoltaic modules at industrial scale, supplying both domestic and export markets.

#### Why Solar Panel Manufacturing Matters
Local manufacturing reduces dependence on imported panels, shortens supply chains, lowers transportation emissions, enhances energy security, and supports industrial job creation.

#### Factory Capacity and Scope
The Solaris facility is designed for annual production capacity of approximately 700 megawatts, high-volume standardized module assembly, quality control, and scalability.
